ESP32 Arduino Z-code Interpreter Program - with VGA and PS2 Keyboard

This version of the Z-code interpreter is derived from Jzip created by John Holder.
More information about Jzip, including the source code can by found here:
http://jzip.sourceforge.net/

The original Code for the AZIP is a copy of this git project 
https://github.com/talofer99/AZIP
 

*** UPDATE 26/4/2021: 

Thanks to @guidol70 the SD was moved the pinout of the TTGO VGA32 and the SD init was chnaged. 
#define SS 13.
#define SDMHZ 25
#define SPIINIT 14,2,12,SS // TTGO_VGA32 (sck, miso, mosi, cs)
#define SDINIT SS, SD_SCK_MHZ(SDMHZ)
QUIT command the board will restart to allow choosing new game. 
TODO: work out the save/load and then we can choose new game without restart. 


Software Dependencies:
SDFAT library: https://github.com/greiman/SdFat
fabGL library: https://github.com/fdivitto/FabGL

Hardware Dependencies:
Formatted SD card - fat16 use SD card Formater 

The fabgl library has schamtics for the VGA and the PS2 connections. 
I used the original pinout for the ps2, but moved 2 of the VGA pins that were using SPI pins that 
were needed for the SD card. 


Getting Started Steps:
1. Copy a Z-Machine game file to the SD card and name it "ZORKI.DAT".
2. Compile and upload the sketch to the Arduino.


I have include a copy Mini-Zork I downloaded from here:
http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXdemos.html

Game files can be found several places on the internet, a good source for games is The Interactive Fiction Archive:

Zork I, II, and III can be downloaded here:

Limitations:
Due to the limits of RAM and FLASH, removed most of the screen handling capability. 
Game save and restore capability are removed.
